<p>Academic Honesty is very important for our society. This includes being honest about your test, quizzes or anything you have cheated on. This also can result in being treated poorly if not telling the truth. Academically honest could also mean speaking up if you need help with an assignment rather than cheating or setting yourself up to fail. Help your self in ways that improve your academic preformance and your teachers knowledge about your school work.</p>
